//Create a folder for project:
cd *project folder*


//Start VM (I want linux, defined by jammy64)
vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64
vagrant up

// Go into VM - note we can see it in VirtualBox and go in there, or use following command
vagrant ssh

// Explore
// the following command shows that your project folder is shared in the VM

ls /vagrant


//Download Apache so that we can run a web server
// update package and install the apache - need to "sudo" to give us admin rights. The apache to install can be seen at the top of the first search, based on http server
apt search apache
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2

//Test connection
//localhost:80 is based on http being port 80
// can use this for other sites eg curl -v http://example.com
//https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline/options
curl -v localhost:80


// Set up networking
// use following command to show you two IP addresses - one it refers to itself, and one it uses to identify to the network (the second is used to access the VM from the laptop)
ip addr

// VirtualBox blocks access by default
// find vagrantfile and allow public part, makes machine appear as another device on the network
// now when re-running "ip addr" it will give a website, showing success

// feel free to play around and editing site, using following
cd /var/www/html
sudo nano index.html
